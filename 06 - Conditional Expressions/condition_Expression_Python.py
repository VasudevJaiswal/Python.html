# Chapter 06 – Conditional Expressions ?

# Sometimes we want to play pubg on our phone if the day is Sunday.

# Sometimes we order Ice-cream online if the day is sunny.

# Sometimes we go hiking if our parents allow.

# All these are decisions that depend on the condition being met.

# In python programming too, we must be able to execute instructions on a condition(s) being met. This is what conditions are for!

# If else and elif in Python
# @ @ @ @IMP If else and elif statements are a multiway decision taken by our program due to certain conditions in our code.

# Syntax: ?


# if (condition1):		// if condition 1 is true
# 	print(“yes”)
# elif (condition2):		// if condition 2 is true
# 	print(“No”)
# else:				// otherwise
# 	print(“May be”)


a = 45
