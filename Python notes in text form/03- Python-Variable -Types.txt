       Chapter -1             Python - Variables Types

# Variables are nothing but Reserved memory locations to #Store Values  .
It means that when we create a variable , We Reserve some space in memory 


        @ Assigning Values to Variables ::

# Python variables do not need explicit declaration to Reserve memory space.
The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable.

   # The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables .

Exp:: 

     1. Counter = 100     #An Integer Assignment 
     2. miles = 1000.23   #An Floating points Assignment
     3. name = "Vasudev"  #An String Assignment
     4. age = 19          #An Integer Assignment
